# time-tracker
An advanced iOS time-tracker for Obsidian
# Introduction
I've been using [Obsidian](obsidian.org) and a personal knowledge system (PKS) now for over 6 months after using (#TODO previous iOS journaling app) for several years.  I'm interesting in a time-tracking system that will do the following:

  1. Track my time on my [Daily Notes](#todo Daily Notes plugin) and any other Obsidian note pages I want to include.
  2. Resolution: round to nearest second.
  3. Work on two-column markdown tables:
        - The left column contains the time in `moment.js` format **MM:SS**.
        - The right column contains the activity that I'm tracking.
        - The activity will frequently include **Wikipedia**-formatted links to other notes.

***TODO**: continue*
